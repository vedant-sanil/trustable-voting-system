The given project does not contain any seperate dependenices which need to be installed. All basic Java and Javax libraries have been used.


The project can be run as follows:

Modify necessary fields in test/Config.java.

Run checkpoint tests:
make checkpoint

Run final tests:
make test

Run blockchain speed test:
make speed


Time taken as a team for checkpoint - 15 hrs

Time taken as a team for post checkpoint - 20 hrs

Major pain points was Cast Vote which involved encryption, decryption. Maybe a bit more information in Class apart from the Crypto Primer would have helped.
